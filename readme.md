## What does it do?
Creates a button on orsr.sk that opens a new tab with the firm's page on finstat.sk. I am not affiliated with the Company register neither with Finstat. This extension is just a faster way to get to financial data about a company.

## How do I install it?
I would suggest to open the extensions page on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fin-rsr/fjblcanpcgkflofabegihkabmiobfmon) and install it from there. 

## Privacy
No user data is used or stored by the extension.
